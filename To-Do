// Code wise
1. Modularize Calling models
2. Check SAC
3. Check PPO
4. Check DQN
5. Check MADDPG
6. Save env configs in YAML
7. Write Evaluation Scripts
8. Write modular shell script

// Project wise
1. Determine which models to compare
2. Determine evaluation parameters
3. Go through Checkpoints config and results JSON for valuable data to be plotted
4. Determine comparative analysis b/w (models, configs - vs Performance (reward[heatmap]))

// Done
1. Train.py ran and tested
2. DDPG (as by Jayanth)
3. Saving checkpoints
4. Saving results
